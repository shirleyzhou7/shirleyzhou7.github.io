          Working in a team of three, we created a kickstarter video for our product Shine, an IoT connected-scale alarm to help people get up easier in the mornings

        <h4> Survey and Results</h4>
        <p> From all the scenarios listed, we decided to focus on the first one, help people get out of bed. Before moving forward, we conducted a survey to validate if people do need help for getting out of bed and see how big the market is. </p>

        <h4> Product Description: </h4>
        <p class = "text-left">
        Shine is different from other alarms in that it tunes and preps your surroundings to make the best wake up environment possible. Similar systems cost up to 300 dollars but at 50 dollars Shine will bring you a quick and highly-effective wake up system and encourage interaction between you and your loved ones at the same time.
50 dollars will get you an entire system perfect for one person in a bed of any size. If youâ€™re a couple you can receive two Shine systems at a discounted price of 75 dollars with one installed on each side of the bed.
As aforementioned, Shine can be hooked up on the Cloud to be synced with devices such as your coffee machine or thermostat. If you are a developer who is interested in integrating specific devices with the Shine alarm system, we have opportunities for you to do so. If you are interested in joining our developer program, we will send you a device at no fee.
Join Shine, take your mornings back.

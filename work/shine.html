        <p class = "font-weight-light"> Interaction designers are increasingly asked to create videos as part of their practice. They use video to capture user research, often producing highlight reels toconvey points to clients and key decision makers.They use video to give form to a proposed user experience,to pitch concepts,and to gain buy-in. Finally, interaction designers increasingly make videos to summarize and introduce design work at the beginning of a presentation, for asynchronous communication and in their portfolios. Understanding how to quickly produce an appealing video—including scripting, shooting, and editing—has become as important as knowing how to interview, synthesize, wireframeand create documents.

        This project involves a type of design thinking called matchmaking. Most UX projects follow a user-centered design process of studying people and inventing new things to meet their needs. Sometimes, however, companies own or control a technology that they want to exploit. To address this challenge, designers engage in matchmaking: searching for good intersections of a target set of users and the abilities of this technology.

          Working in a team of three, we created a kickstarter video for our product Shine, an IoT connected-scale alarm to help people get up easier in the mornings

        <p class = "font-weight-light"> From all the scenarios listed, we decided to focus on the first one, help people get out of bed. Before moving forward, we conducted a survey to validate if people do need help for getting out of bed and see how big the market is. </p>

        <p class = "font-weight-light">
        Shine is different from other alarms in that it tunes and preps your surroundings to make the best wake up environment possible. Similar systems cost up to 300 dollars but at 50 dollars Shine will bring you a quick and highly-effective wake up system and encourage interaction between you and your loved ones at the same time.
50 dollars will get you an entire system perfect for one person in a bed of any size. If you’re a couple you can receive two Shine systems at a discounted price of 75 dollars with one installed on each side of the bed.
        </p>
        <p class = "font-weight-light">
          As aforementioned, Shine can be hooked up on the Cloud to be synced with devices such as your coffee machine or thermostat. If you are a developer who is interested in integrating specific devices with the Shine alarm system, we have opportunities for you to do so. If you are interested in joining our developer program, we will send you a device at no fee.
        </p>

          Join Shine, take your mornings back.

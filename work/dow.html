          Adapting Content to different audiences: I designed a formal report to relay information to both the engineering and marketing department of the Dow Chemical Company.

        <br>
        <p class="font-weight-light">
          Formal reports are often created to pitch an idea for a product, service, or system. Because readers initially scan pages rather than doing a deep read, it is important that headings and images capture and quickly communicate the gist of a project or investigation.
          <br>
          <br>
          For this assignment I was given raw text pertaining to the subject of industrial ecology. Choosing from the list of clientsand audiences, I created a harmonious design for a 16-page report that speaks to the needs of my client and audiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a designer, I quickly learned that the companies I designed for (their clients) are made up of internal audiences who do not necessarily share the same point of view. It is the job of a designer to address multiple audiences simultaneously.

        <h4> Layout Exploration </h4>
        <br>
        <p class = "font-weight-light">
        I experimented with different layout styles, gridding, and white space, looking for a design that would best suit both engineer and marketing audiences.

      <h4> Color Pallette Decisions</h4>
      <p class = "font-weight-light">
        Industrial Ecology is not a very approachable/interesting topic that people are “drawn” to
        <br>
        <br>
        Wanted a light-weight color scheme that would contrast with the density of information being given in the report.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to convey aspects of ecology, nature, appreciation for environment I went with a blue, green color scheme because it was approachable, calming and light
        Later on matched the outer and inner cover photos with these colors to create a sense of completeness

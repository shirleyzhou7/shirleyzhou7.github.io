          Care/of delivers personalized vitamin packets to individuals on a monthly basis. The user takes a quiz that identifies oneâ€™s goals, lifestyle and values and Care/of produces a list of recommended vitamins.

          I chose care/of because they bundle vitamins and get rid of the hassle of having 5-6 bottles of pills which you repetitively open up and take each morning. They are also very thoughtful about their product/service and their users.

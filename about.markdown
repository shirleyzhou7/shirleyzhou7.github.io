##### Hi there! I'm 周雪睿.

##### A Canadian-born Chinese American (make of that what you will) currently at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.deloittedigital.com) working to improve design and functionality of government products. Previously, I studied Information Systems, Human Computer Interaction, and Business at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu).
##### I spend a lot of time pondering the differences of eastern/western culture. They actively inform my design, [illustration](https://www.instagram.com/shur.png), and various life decisions.

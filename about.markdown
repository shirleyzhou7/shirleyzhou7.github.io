title: About Me
---


I studied at Carnegie Mellon with a major in Information systems and double minors in business and HCI. Iâ€™m currently at Deloitte Digital trying to make government products better. I spend a lot of time pondering the differences of eastern/western culture. They actively inform my design, illustration, and various life decisions.

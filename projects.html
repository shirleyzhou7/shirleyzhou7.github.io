    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p> This page isn't completed yet, but here are some of the projects I've done in the past. You can find more on my portfolio <a href="portfolio.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Formal Booklet Design</h3>

    <p>Adapting Content to different audiences: I designed a formal report to relay information to both the engineering and marketing department of the Dow Chemical Company. I experimented with different layout styles, gridding, and white space, looking for a design that would best suit both engineer and marketing audiences.</p>
    <p>Skills: typography study, addressing needs of multiple audiences, ideation with sketching, designing a system</p>

    <h3>Shine: helps take your mornings back</h3>
    <a><img src="images/shine-logo.png"></a>
    <p>Working in a team of three, we created a kickstarter video for our product Shine, an IoT connected-scale alarm to help people get up easier in the mornings. <a href="https://youtu.be/84TpG2kLs3Y/">Watch our kickstarter video</a>.</p>

    <p>Product Description:</p>
    <p>Shine is different from other alarms in that it tunes and preps your surroundings to make the best wake up environment possible. Similar systems cost up to 300 dollars but at 50 dollars Shine will bring you a quick and highly-effective wake up system and encourage interaction between you and your loved ones at the same time.
    50 dollars will get you an entire system perfect for one person in a bed of any size. If youâ€™re a couple you can receive two Shine systems at a discounted price of 75 dollars with one installed on each side of the bed.

    As aforementioned, Shine can be hooked up on the Cloud to be synced with devices such as your coffee machine or thermostat. If you are a developer who is interested in integrating specific devices with the Shine alarm system, we have opportunities for you to do so. If you are interested in joining our developer program, we will send you a device at no fee.

    Join Shine, take your mornings back.</p>

    <p>Skills: Scripting, Storyboarding, Video Shooting and Editing, UI Design, Graphic Design, Creating surveys</p>

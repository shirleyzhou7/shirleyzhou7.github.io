        <h4> Thoughts </h4>
        <p class="font-weight-light">
          Formal reports are often created to pitch an idea for a product, service, or system. Because readers initially scan pages rather than doing a deep read, it is important that headings and images capture and quickly communicate the gist of a project or investigation.
          <br>
          <br>
          For this assignment I was given raw text pertaining to the subject of industrial ecology. Choosing from the list of clientsand audiences, I created a harmonious design for a 16-page report that speaks to the needs of my client and audiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a designer, I quickly learned that the companies I designed for (their clients) are made up of internal audiences who do not necessarily share the same point of view. It is the job of a designer to address multiple audiences simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h4> Layout Exploration </h4>
        <br>
        <p class = "font-weight-light">
        I experimented with different layout styles, gridding, and white space, looking for a design that would best suit both engineer and marketing audiences.
        Deciding between a two-column and three-column grid, I went with three columns because it allowed for more white space between columns and was more flexible

      <h4> Color Pallette Decisions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Industrial Ecology is not a very approachable/interesting topic that people are “drawn” to</li>
        <li>Wanted a light-weight color scheme that would contrast with the density of information being given in the report</li>
        <li>In order to convey aspects of ecology, nature, appreciation for environment I went with a blue, green color scheme because it was approachable, calming and light</li>
        <li>Later on matched the outer and inner cover photos with these colors to create a sense of completeness</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Font Considerations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Want something modern, for marketers and engineers</li>
        <li>Decided on a sans serif font with some serif accents through</li>
        <li>Switched from Gil Sans regular to Gil Sans Light Regular seemed too heavy and contrasted with the light feeling of the overall formal report</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Size and Spacing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed leading from 18pt in first iteration and eventually switched to 14 pt because the former was too airy.</li>
        <li>Changed justified columns to ragged to make it seem more natural</li>
        <li>Changed body type size from 14 to 12 because the large size of the 14pt font made the report seem child- like or directed towards a
          fairly young audience instead of seeming sophisticated and tailored for engi- neers and marketers</li>
